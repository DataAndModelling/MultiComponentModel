    "\n",
    "In general for a multi-component vehicle, a business owner would like to minimise his spending on spare parts for the components, while reaching certain serviceability levels which his customers are happy with. \n",
    "\n",
    "For consumable spares, since they are thrown away, the average rate of consumption can be calculated, and from there stock holding levels optimised against MOQ and re-stock times. A poisson model can be used to approximate the holdings needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "For reparable spares, since they are repaired, a more complex model is needed. The Turn Around Time for the component to be repaired also affects the serviceability of the fleet (which in turn affects revenue). Mistakes in procurement of reparable spares can also be costly to fix downstream (since they cost so much), and also have substantial procurement lead times (so they cannot be fixed overnight). \n",
    "\n",
    "So in general, there are two questions to answer for reparable spares:\n",
    "1) Given a fixed budget, what is the ideal procurement number of each spare?\n",
    "2) Given a varying scale of budgets, what serviceability of my fleet can I expect?\n",
